# [Random Quote Machine](https://bracar.github.io/quotes)

## Random Quote Machine is an exercise project  for freecodecamp.org

The goal of this project is learning HTML, CSS, JS, making AJAX requests and parsing JSON responses.

My personal goals:
* Usability on different screen sizes
* Simple, no-distraction design
* Maintain basic functionality in case of a lost connection
* Provide some touch (swipe) functionality

Finished product:
* on [github pages](https://bracar.github.io/quotes)
* on [codepen](https://codepen.io/bracar/full/ZvPZyd)
